          Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of
          websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web
          programming, and database management. It is the creation of an
          application that works over the internet i.e. websites.

          Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a robot
          controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans
          because they require human intelligence and discernment.

              Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can
              improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data,
              known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions
              without being explicitly programmed to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
              The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an
              American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and
              artificial intelligence.

              Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of
              a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial
              neural networks with representation learning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses
              multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features
              from the raw input.
            </li>
            <li>
              The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of
              multiple layers in the network.
