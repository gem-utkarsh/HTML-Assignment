                <li>Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.</li>
                <li>Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.</li>
                <li>The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.</li>

                <li>Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.</li>
                <li>Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input.</li>
                <li>The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network.</li>
